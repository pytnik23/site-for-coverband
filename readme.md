# [Landing Page for music group](https://pwcoverband.com.ua/)

### My task was to create a fully responsive landing page for a cover band. On the page need to be:

- a full-width main photo with a header
- a photo-gallery with a full-width and touch friendly interface
- an action form that sends data to the client's email
- a nice carousel of testimonials

Technology and instruments that I used:
HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery, AJAX, Bootstrap(only grid), PHP, Gulp, Git.
